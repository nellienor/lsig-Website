                    <h1>CHILDHOOD</h1>
                    <p>Born on 1 July 1985, Léa Seydoux is the daughter of businessman Henri Jérôme Seydoux-Fornier de Clausonne and Valérie Schlumberger. She was born in Passy, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, and grew up in Saint-Germain-des-Prés in the 6th arrondissement.She had a strict Protestant upbringing,but she is not religious.Seydoux is one of seven children. She has three older half-siblings from her mother's first marriage, an older sister, stylist Camille Seydoux from her parents' marriage, and a further two paternal half-brothers from her father's marriage to model Farida Khelfa.</p>
                    <p>Seydoux's parents divorced when she was three years old and they were often away, her mother in Africa and her father on business, which, combined with her large family, meant that she "felt lost in the crowd... I was very lonely as a kid. Really I always had the feeling I was an orphan." Through her family involvement in media and entertainment, Seydoux grew up acquainted with prominent artists such as photographer Nan Goldin, musicians Lou Reed and Mick Jagger and footwear designer Christian Louboutin.For six years, Seydoux went to summer camp in the United States, at the behest of her father, who wanted her to learn to speak English.</p>

                    <h1>CAREER BEGINNING</h1>
                    <p>Seydoux says that as a child she wanted to become an opera singer, studying music at the Conservatoire de Paris, but eventually her shyness compelled her to drop the idea.It was not until the age of eighteen that she decided to become an actress.One of her friends was an actor, and Seydoux has said: "I found his life wonderful, I thought, 'Oh my god, you can travel, you're free, you can do what you want, you're the boss.'" She fell in love with an actor and decided to become an actress to impress him. She took acting classes at French drama school Les Enfants Terribles,and in 2007 she took further training at New York's Actors Studio with Corinne Blue.</p>
                    <p>In 2005, Seydoux appeared in the music video for Raphaël's single "Ne partons pas fâchés". The following year, Seydoux played her first major screen role as one of the main characters in Sylvie Ayme's Girlfriends (Mes copines). She starred in Nicolas Klotz's short film La Consolation, which was exhibited at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.
                    In these years, she also did her first work as a model for American Apparel, posing for their Pantytime campaign,and had a role in the films 13 French Street and The Last Mistress.</p>

                    <h1>FRENCH CINEMA AND HOLLYWOOD EXPANSION</h1>
                    <p>Seydoux came to widespread attention in 2008,when she appeared in Christophe Honoré's The Beautiful Person, a role that earned her the 2009 Chopard Award at the Cannes Film Festival for "Best Upcoming Actress" and a César Award nomination for Most Promising Actress.
                    In 2009, she had a major part in Jessica Hausner's Lourdes,and a small role in her first Hollywood film, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. In 2010 she starred alongside Russell Crowe in Ridley Scott's Robin Hood, playing Isabella of Angoulême. </p>
                    <p id="hidden">In 2011, she played Gabrielle in the romantic comedy Midnight in Paris. She later participated in another Hollywood production, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, in which she played the assassin Sabine Moreau alongside stars Tom Cruise and Jeremy Renner. She also played Elle in the short film Time Doesn't Stand Still by Benjamin Millepied and Asa Mader . 
                    In 2012, she starred in Farewell, My Queen. The film opened the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival where it was met with critical acclaim.Critics praised director Benoît Jacquot's decision to cast Seydoux in the key role of Sidonie, stating "her luminous but watchful eyes suggest a soul wise beyond her years." Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Seydoux was an excellent choice for the part calling her a remarkably versatile young actress and pointed to the stark difference in her characters from her previous roles in Midnight in Paris and Mission: Impossible. That year, Seydoux also filmed Blue Is the Warmest Colour by Abdellatif Kechiche, and Grand Central by Rebecca Zlotowski, both exhibited at the 66th Cannes Film Festival.

                    In September 2016, Seydoux announced that she and her boyfriend André Meyer were expecting their first child. On 18 January 2017, she gave birth to a son, Georges.

                    <p>
                    Seydoux has said that the filming of Blue Is the Warmest Colour made her question her sexuality: "Of course I did [question it]. Me as a person, as a human being ... It's not nothing, making those scenes. Of course I question myself. But, I did not have any revelations."She has expressed a preference for defining herself by the term "actor" rather than "actress", saying: "I really don't feel like an actress, I feel like an actor."
                    In July 2021, Seydoux tested positive for COVID-19, was asymptomatic and isolating at her Paris home. The diagnosis caused her to skip the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.
